<p>Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. We have a fantastic little sky!

  Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Everybody needs a friend. You can do anything your heart can imagine.
  
  Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Every day I learn.
  
  Just beat the devil out of it. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Let's make a nice big leafy tree.
  
  Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Let's put a touch more of the magic here.
  
  Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. In your world you can create anything you desire. There comes a nice little fluffer.
  
  Do an almighty painting with us. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring.
